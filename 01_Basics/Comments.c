Comments are notes you write inside your code. The compiler completely ignores them - they exist only to help humans understand the code.

To write a single-line comment, use //. Everything after // until the end of the line is ignored:

// This is a comment
printf("Hello, World!");

Note: Every multi-line comment that starts with /* must be closed with */, 
otherwise the compiler treats everything after it as a comment.

/* This is a multi-line comment.
   The compiler ignores all of it. */
printf("Welcome!");

CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
// This is not executable because it is commented using double slash "//".
printf("This is exe.");}
